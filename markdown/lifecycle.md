## DID Lifecycle

All `did:cid` DIDs begin life anchored to IPFS. Once created they can be used immediately by any application or service connected to a node that can resolve the seed document from IPFS. Subsequent updates to the DID (meaning that a document associated with the DID changes) are registered on a [[ref: registry]] such as a blockchain (BTC, ETH, etc.) or a decentralized database (e.g., hyperswarm). The registry is specified at DID creation so that nodes can determine which single source of truth to check for updates.

The **key concept of this design** is that DID creation is decentralized through IPFS, and DID updates are decentralized through the registry specified in the DID creation. The DID is decentralized for its whole lifecycle, which is a hard requirement of DIDs.

### Lifecycle States

| State | `deactivated` | Document | Description |
|-------|---------------|----------|-------------|
| Created | `false` | Seed document | Initial anchor on IPFS, resolvable immediately |
| Active | `false` | Latest version | One or more valid updates applied |
| Revoked | `true` | `id` only | Controller removed, no further mutations possible |
